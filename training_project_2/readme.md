Requirements:

- Your project 2 pitch should involve some analysis of twitter data.  This can be the central feature.  Your final application should work, to some extent, with both streaming and historical data.
- Send me a link to a git repo, have someone in the group manage git (but they can ask for help from me)
- Produce a one or more .jar files for your analysis.  Multiple smaller jar files are preferred.
